I currently am working on feature implementation and bug fixing for a ReactJS based app at DirecTV which is a UI for browsing movie and television show info in the form of lists containing scrolling carousels of movie posters, running times, time left on live broadcasts, etc.

I chose to use ReactJS to take a hierarchical component based approach to the movie search mini app since the lines in the movies list could be made of a reusable component for each movie result in the movie list.

The code represents the start of an implementation of a ReactJS based solution to the coding challenge rather than a fully working demo given the time constraints to set up the project, think of how to organize the components, etc.

The code in the src folder on GitHub represents my thinking and approach to the movie search task.  I got as far as getting the component structure setup in the code and the upper part of the UI displayed.

To run the code on a localhost

1) In a command prompt of a computer with NodeJS installed type "npm start"

2) Point browser to localhost:3000

3) npm run build can be used to make the build folder to a minified version of the software
